# DREAM
A novel system for accelerating the reconstruction process on PMA-based dynamic graph processing systems. DREAM has been integrated into three existing systems: PPCSR(https://github.com/domargan/parallel-packed-csr), Terrace(https://github.com/PASSIONLab/terrace), and VCSR(https://github.com/DIR-LAB/VCSR).
